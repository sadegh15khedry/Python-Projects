# dotFunction

This repository contains code for implementing a dot product function for two hard-coded matrices.

## Summary

The code in this repository demonstrates the implementation of a dot product function, specifically designed to perform the dot product operation on two hard-coded matrices. The dot product function takes two matrices as input, performs the dot product operation, and returns the result. The purpose of this implementation is to showcase a basic example of matrix manipulation and arithmetic operations.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the dot product function implementation in the source code files.
3. Use the dot product function to perform the dot product operation on two matrices, providing the matrices as input to the function.
4. Retrieve the result of the dot product operation from the function and use it as required in your application.
